NAME
    Devel::Local - Use development versions of other modules

SYNOPSIS
        > export PERL5LIB=`perl -MDevel::Local=PERL5LIB`
        > export PATH=`perl -MDevel::Local=PATH`

DESCRIPTION
    Sometimes when you are developing software there can several module code
    repositories involved. This module lets you specify which repositories
    you want to load modules from, and formats them into a PERL5LIB
    environment variable format.

    Devel::Local takes a list of Perl module repositories that you specify
    in your current directory or your home directory. It adds the absolute
    paths of the lib/ subdirectories to the current value of PERL5LIB. It
    can also add the bin/ subdirectories to your PATH environment variable.
    It prints the new value to STDOUT and then exits.

    NOTE: If Devel::Local runs into problems, it will warn about them, but
    still print your environment variable.

USAGE
    Create a file called "~/.perl-devel-local" that has lines like this:

        # Use the GitHub versions of these:
        ~/src/yaml-libyaml-pm/
        ~/src/catalyst-runtime/

    for generic values, or a file called "./devel-runtime" that looks like
    this:

        # Use the GitHub versions of these:
        ../yaml-libyaml-pm/
        ../catalyst-runtime/

    for project specific values.

    You may also use any other config file path you wish, by setting the
    "PERL_DEVEL_LOCAL" environment variable.

    NOTE: Devel::Local will ignore all the lines in the config file after
    the first blank line. This way, you can put several groupings of devel
    libraries in one file. Just make sure that the grouping you want to use
    is at the top of the file.

BASH
    You may want to put a function like this one in your .bashrc file:

        function devel-local() {
            export PERL5LIB=`perl -MDevel::Local=PERL5LIB`
            export PATH=`perl -MDevel::Local=PATH`
        }

    Then any time you want to use Devel::Local values, you can just run:

        > devel-local

    from the command line. That's all you need to do!
